      <h3> Questions </h3>
      <ul>
        <li> What do semantic elements help with? Does this serve as an organizing function alone? Or does it also improve search functionality through search engines?</li>
        <li>What is the esversion 6 in the script mean?</li>
        <li>In the first assignment this week I couldnt create an array in the object for some reason so I created it outside? Is this the right way or did I miss something?</li>
